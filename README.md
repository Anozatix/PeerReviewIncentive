## Project Description

The "Peer Review Incentives" project aims to enhance student engagement in the peer review process by introducing a blockchain-based reward system. This platform incentivizes students to participate in peer reviews by awarding them with digital tokens for each review they complete. The system ensures that the peer review process is transparent, accountable, and rewarding, thereby improving the quality of feedback and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Key Features

- **Token Rewards:** Students earn tokens for completing peer reviews, motivating them to provide quality feedback.
  
- **Blockchain Transparency:** All peer reviews are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring an immutable and transparent record of all reviews.
  
- **Decentralized Platform:** Operates on a decentralized system, removing the need for intermediaries and allowing for a fair and open review process.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for students to participate in reviews, track their tokens, and engage with the platform.

## Project Vision

The vision of the "Peer Review Incentives" project is to transform the traditional peer review process into an interactive and rewarding experience. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to create a transparent and decentralized system that encourages students to actively participate in peer reviews. This not only improves the quality of feedback but also promotes a culture of collaboration, accountability, and continuous learning within educational institutions.
